        <h3>About Me!</h3>
        <h4>I am a lover of music.</h4>
          <p>Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I've played piano since I was very young and recently began playing guitar. I am also an avid music listener, always searching for new and interesting music. I'm a big fan of hip hop, rock, and ambient music.

        <h4>I'm a server in a restaurant.</h4>
          <p>My current job is working as a server in a high end Italian restaurant. I've been in the industry for three years and have since developed excellent teamwork skills. Working in a restaurant requires a lot of communication and organization, skills that I've been able to hone in.

          </p>
        <h4>I enjoy playing games.</h4>
          <p>Often in my free time I'll find myself playing video games. They help me escape reality for a bit and unwind after work. Some of my favorites are Super Smash Bros, Halo, Minecraft, and Dark Souls III.
